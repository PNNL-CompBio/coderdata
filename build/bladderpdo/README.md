# Bladder Patient Derived Organoid Dataset

This dataset comes from a [2018 publication](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867418302976?via%3Dihub) (Lee et. al., 2018) that created several bladder PDO lines from xenografts in mice and performed sequencing and drug experiments. 

## Samples

Sample information can be found on Synapse [here](https://www.synapse.org/Synapse:syn64765486).

## Omics Data

This study had copy number variation, RNA-seq and mutation data that was included. 

Copy number data is available at [this synapse link](https://www.synapse.org/Synapse:syn64765499). Mutation data is available at [this synapse link](https://www.synapse.org/Synapse:syn64765525). RNA-Seq data was acquired from GEO, we used the 'GSE1039990_Normalized_counts.txt.gz' table available on GEO [GSE103990](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE103990). 

## Drug Dose-Response Experiments

For these data, we had complete drug dose-response data to recalculate curves, available on Synapse in the [Lee Bladder PDO Datasets](https://www.synapse.org/Synapse:syn64765430) folder.

### Introduction
CoderData is a cancer benchmark data package developed in Python and R. 
There are two aspects of this package, the backend build section and the user facing python package.
The build section is a github workflow that generates four cancer datasets in a format that is easy for users and algorithms to ingest. 
The python package allows users to easily download the data, load it into python and reformat it as desired.

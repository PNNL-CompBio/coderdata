## Guide to Adding Code to CoderData

### Introduction
This guide outlines the steps for contributors looking to add new code functionalities to CoderData, including automation scripts, Docker integration, and continuous integration processes.

### 1. Automate Credentials and Data Pulling
- ***Script Development***: Write a script to automate credential management and data pulling, ensuring secure handling of API keys or authentication tokens.
- ***Data Formatting***: The script should reformat the pulled data to fit CoderData's existing schema.
- ***Environment Variables***: Store sensitive information such as API keys in environment variables for security.

### 2. Writing Tests
- ***Unit Tests***: Create unit tests for each function in your script.
- ***Data Tests***: Implement data tests to verify your data is accessing APIs correctly, properly formatted, and matches the schema.

### 3. Dockerization
- ***Dockerfile Creation***: Write a Dockerfile to containerize your script, specifying dependencies, environment setup, and entry points.
- ***Local Testing***: Test the Docker container locally to confirm correct functionality.

### 4. GitHub Actions for Automation
- ***Workflow Setup***: Design a GitHub Actions workflow to automate the script execution. You may directly update our version, or create a seperate workflow and we could join it to ours.  This should include:
  - Trigger mechanisms (schedule or events).
  - Secret management for credentials.
  - Error logging and handling.
  - Seperate steps for samples file generation and the rest of the data generation.

### 5. Updating Documentation
- ***Documentation Revision***: Update the project documentation to reflect your new script's purpose and usage.
- ***Usage Examples***: Provide clear examples and usage instructions.

### 6. Continuous Integration
- ***CI Integration***: Integrate your script into the existing Continuous Integration pipeline.
- ***CI Testing***: Ensure your script is included in the CI testing process to prevent future breakages.

### 7. Pull Request and Code Review
- ***Create a Pull Request***: Submit your changes via a pull request to the main CoderData repository.

### 8. Align with Repository Standards
- ***Review Project Guidelines***: Familiarize yourself with the CoderData project's standards and practices to align your contribution accordingly.

### Conclusion
Contributors are encouraged to follow these guidelines closely for effective integration of new code into the CoderData project. We appreciate your contributions and look forward to your innovative enhancements to the project.

Here we are focused on getting the details from a model prediction algorithm - where did it fail, where did it succeed?

## Data and packages

First we get the packages loaded and logged into synapse.
```{r setup, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo  =  TRUE)
library(tidyverse)
library(synapser)
library(ggplot2)
library(ggridges)
synapser::synLogin()

```


The data has been uploaded by natasha and can be downloaded as follows.

```{r download data}


```



## Create funtion to dive in



```{r}

```

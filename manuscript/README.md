## Coderdata Manuscript Figure Generation  

This folder contains the scripts necessary to evaluate and visualize the results in our manuscript.

### Figure 1
This figure is primarily generated by hand as it is a depiction of the build process and schema

### Figure 2
This figure is also generated by hand, and a graphic describing the cross-dataset performance.

### Figure 3
These figures will be generated by [./figure3CellLinePlots.Rmd] and include both analysis of the performance 
statistics as well as indepth analysis of predictions. 


### Figure 4
These figures will be generated by [./figure4ExVivoResults.Rmd] and include both analysis of the performance 
statistics as well as indepth analysis of predictions. 


### Figure 5
These figures will be generated by [./figure5MultiOmicsResults.Rmd] and include analysis of our proteomics
prediction.
